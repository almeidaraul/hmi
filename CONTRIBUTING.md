# Contributing
Thanks for considering contributing to HMI!

Check the issues tab to see what you can help with. This is a very simple app so the tasks are mostly also very simple, usually being in one of the following three categories:

* Translation (there's a fixed issue for this)
* Bug fixes
* Small features

The issues are supposed to give you enough information to contribute, but feel free to ask questions in the comment section if you have any. You can also get in contact to discuss new ideas.

**I'm working on a redesign of the app, so there'll soon be more issues.**
